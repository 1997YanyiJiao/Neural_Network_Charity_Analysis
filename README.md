# Overview

The purpose of this project is to use deep-learning neural networks with the TensorFlow platform in Python, to analyze and to predict loan risk for Alphabet Soup.
We use the following methods for the analysis:

* preprocessing the data for the neural network model,
* compile, train and evaluate the model,
* optimize the model.

# Results
## Data Preprocessing

What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model? 
* The target variable for the model was the “IS_SUCCESSFUL.” Column.

What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
* The initial model considered following columns as features: EIN, NAME, APPLICATION_TYPE, AFFILIATION, CLASSIFICATION, USE_CASE, ORGANIZATION, STATUS, INCOME_AMT, SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS, ASK_AMT, IS_SUCCESSFUL.

## Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
